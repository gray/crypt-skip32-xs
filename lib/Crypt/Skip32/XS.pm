=head1 NAME

Crypt::Skip32::XS - Drop-in replacement for Crypt::Skip32

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Crypt::Skip32::XS;

    $cipher     = Crypt::Skip32::XS->new($key);
    $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
    $plaintext  = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Crypt::Skip32::XS> module is similar in function to C<Crypt::Skip32>,
but is substantially faster as it is written in C/XS instead of pure Perl.

NOTE: As of version 0.10, Crypt::Skip32 automatically uses this module if
it is installed.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item new

    $cipher = Crypt::Skip32::XS->new($key);

Creates a new Crypt::Skip32::XS cipher object with the given key. The key
B<must> be 10 bytes long.

=item encrypt

    $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);

Encrypts plaintext and returns the ciphertext.  The plaintext B<must> be of 4
bytes long.

=item decrypt

    $plaintext = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

Decrypts ciphertext and returns the plaintext.  The ciphertext B<must> be 4
bytes long.

=item blocksize

    $blocksize = $cipher->blocksize;
    $blocksize = Crypt::Skip32::XS->blocksize;

Returns the size (in bytes) of the block cipher, which is always 4.

=item keysize

    $keysize = $cipher->keysize;
    $keysize = Crypt::Skip32::XS->keysize;

Returns the size (in bytes) of the key, which is always 10.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

This distribution contains a benchmarking script which compares
C<Crypt::Skip32::XS> with C<Crypt::Skip32>.  These are the results on a
MacBook 2GHz with Perl 5.8.8:

    Benchmark: running perl, xs for at least 1 CPU seconds...
          perl:  1 wallclock secs ( 1.07 usr +  0.01 sys =  1.08 CPU) @ 3555.56/s (n=3840)
            xs:  1 wallclock secs ( 1.08 usr +  0.01 sys =  1.09 CPU) @ 263044.95/s (n=286719)
             Rate  perl    xs
    perl   3542/s    --  -99%
